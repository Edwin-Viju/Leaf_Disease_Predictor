# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify plant leaf images and detect potential diseases.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: PlantVillage (from Kaggle)
- **Model Type**: CNN
- **Framework**: TensorFlow 2.x / Keras
- **Output**: Predicts the disease class of a plant leaf image

## 🚀 Features

- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN-based image classifier
- Model evaluation and testing
- Saved model for inference (`.h5` format)
- Option to upload and test custom images

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model uses several convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers for classification. The final layer uses `softmax` for multi-class classification.
